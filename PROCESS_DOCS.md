# BlocoManager Development Process Documentation

This document tracks the step-by-step development process for the BlocoManager site, from initial setup to deployment and feature implementation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

BlocoManager is a modern React application built with Vite and TypeScript, designed for managing blocos. This documentation serves as a development roadmap and progress tracker.

## 📋 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Foundation ✅
- [x] **Create Vite Project**
  - Set up React + TypeScript + Vite boilerplate
  - Configure ESLint and build tools
  - Verify successful compilation and development server
  - Status: Completed - Project scaffolded and running on localhost:5173

### Phase 2: Deployment Infrastructure 🔄
- [x] **Figure out environment strategy**
  - Define environment configurations for dev, qa, and prod
  - **dev**: Local development only (localhost:5173)
  - **qa**: GitHub Pages deployment for testing/staging (PR-based)
  - **prod**: GitHub Pages deployment for production (main branch)
  - Set up environment-specific configurations in Vite
  - Plan branch strategy for deployments

- [x] **Figure out how to deploy it to GitHub Pages**
  - Research GitHub Actions workflow for Vite builds ✅
  - Configure build output for GitHub Pages ✅
  - Set up automated deployment pipeline for qa and prod environments ✅
  - Created `.github/workflows/deploy-qa.yml` for PR-based QA deployments
  - Created `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` for main branch production deployments
  - [ ] Test deployment process with actual PR

- [ ] **Configure domain to point to GitHub Pages deployed site**
  - Set up custom domain DNS configuration
  - Configure GitHub Pages custom domain settings
  - Verify SSL certificate and HTTPS redirect
  - Test domain resolution

### Phase 3: Core Pages Development 📄
- [ ] **Build 404 and Service Unavailable pages**
  - Create custom 404 error page with navigation
  - Design service unavailable/maintenance page
  - Implement proper error routing
  - Add appropriate styling and user guidance

- [ ] **Create Conditions and Terms page**
  - Draft legal terms and conditions content
  - Design responsive terms page layout
  - Implement proper navigation and links
  - Ensure accessibility compliance

### Phase 4: API Integration 🔌
- [ ] **Create service for communicating with API**
  - Design API service architecture
  - Implement HTTP client configuration
  - Add error handling and retry logic
  - Set up authentication mechanisms
  - Create type definitions for API responses

### Phase 5: Future Development 🚀
- [ ] **Additional features to be defined**
  - User authentication system
  - Dashboard implementation
  - Data management interfaces
  - Real-time updates
  - Mobile responsiveness optimization

## 📝 Development Notes

### Current Status
- **Environment**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful compilation
- **Dependencies**: All installed and up to date

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack**: Chose React + Vite for fast development and optimal build performance
2. **TypeScript**: Enabled for better code quality and developer experience
3. **Project Structure**: Following standard Vite React template organization
4. **Environment Strategy**: 
   - **dev**: Local development only (npm run dev)
   - **qa**: GitHub Pages for testing/staging environment
   - **prod**: GitHub Pages for production environment

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Define and implement environment strategy (dev/qa/prod)
2. Research GitHub Pages deployment with Vite
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for qa and prod environments
4. Configure build process for static deployment
